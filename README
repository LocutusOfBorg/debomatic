deb-o-matic - automatic build machine for Debian packages

This is deb-o-matic, an easy-to-use build machine for Debian-based source
packages. It provides a simple tool to automate the building of source
packages with limited user interaction.



INSTALLATION

Installation process is straightforward:

python ./setup.py build
su -c python ./setup.py install

You only need python-dev (or equivalent) and pbuilder packages installed.



CONFIGURATION AND PRELIMINARY SETUP

In order to get deb-o-matic working, you have to prepare a configuration file
(see debomatic.conf.sample for some hints on this phase) and create a package
directory to store deb-o-matic files (packagedir option)



RUNNING DEB-O-MATIC

To start deb-o-matic, you have to launch "debomatic debomatic.conf" command
(where debomatic.conf is configuration file you just created). You need root
privileges to do so because of pbuilder infrastructure.
Now you have to put source packages in the chosen package directory (identified
by packagedir option) and deb-o-matic will take care of the building phase.
Since deb-o-matic requires .changes files, be sure to generate a full Debian
source package by using a command such as dpkg-buildpackage -S -sa. You have
to upload .changes file and each file mentioned under its Files section.
Be sure to have internet access since pbuilder will download some packages in
order to create a minimal build environment.
