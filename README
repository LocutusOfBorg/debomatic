Deb-o-Matic - Automatic build machine for Debian source packages

This is Deb-o-Matic, an easy to use build machine for Debian-based source
packages. It provides a simple tool to automate build of source packages with
limited user interaction and a straightforward configuration.

It has some useful feature such as automatic chroot update, automatic scan
and selection of source packages to build and support for modules.

It is meant to help developers to build their packages without worrying too
much of compilation, since it will run in background and no user feedback
is required during the whole process.

See docs/guide.rst for further details.
