Deb-o-Matic - Automatic build machine for Debian source packages

This is Deb-o-Matic, a easy to use build machine for Debian-based source
packages based on pbuilder. It provides a simple tool to automate the build of 
source packages with limited user interaction and a simple configuration.
It has some useful feature such as automatic update of pbuilder, automatic
scan and selection of source packages to build and lintian/linda support.
It is meant to help developers to build their packages without worrying too
much of compilation, since it will run in background and no user feedback
is required during the whole process.

See docs/guide.html or docs/guide.txt for further details.
